Problem statement: Given a dataset of customer reviews on a product, predict the rating (1-5 stars) of a new review.

Solution:
We will build a multi-class classification model using a Random Forest algorithm to predict the rating (1-5 stars) of a customer review. We will use the "Amazon Fine Food Reviews" dataset from Kaggle, which contains reviews of food products sold on Amazon.

Steps:

Load the dataset and split it into training and testing sets.

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of ratings and their features.

Preprocess the data by performing text cleaning, tokenization, and vectorization using techniques such as TF-IDF.

Train a Random Forest model on the training data.

Evaluate the performance of the model on the testing data by calculating various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Tune hyperparameters of the model using techniques such as grid search or randomized search.

Save the model for future use.

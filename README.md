This code loads the "Amazon Fine Food Reviews" dataset and splits it into training and testing sets. It then performs text cleaning and vectorization using TF-IDF. It trains a Random Forest model on the training data and evaluates the performance of the model on the testing data by calculating accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Finally, it prints the results.

Note that this is just a simple example, and in a real-world scenario, you would likely spend more time on EDA, preprocessing, and hyperparameter tuning to improve the performance of the model. Additionally, you may also consider using more advanced techniques such as neural networks to further improve the model performance.
